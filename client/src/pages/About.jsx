            , this project was inspired both by my kids as well as a personal
            desire to make simple, fun games online to help practice reading and
            math that actually focus on, well...reading and math. One of the
            helpful tools we've used over the years, particularly in the summer
            months, are reading comprehension workbooks. The kids will read a
            passage and then answer a few questions or solve a puzzle
            afterwards. Woof Reading is intended to emulate that experience, but
            to make it also a bit more fun by allowing them to choose a topic
            and a type of story, whether that be a short story, poem, or ballad.
            They can, of course, also win animal badges as they answer questions
            correctly and score points. So that's pretty cool, too.

            Finally, I saw this type of app as a good use of artificial
            intelligence (AI) tools such as Claude (see detail below). I say
            this both for me as a developer in building this app, but also for
            kids, who, in using Woof Reading, can get a curated, basic
            understanding of some of the interesting and beneficial uses of this
            technology. You may have questions or concerns about these tools,
            and I am with you there! Please see the section below for more
            details on how these tools are used and the safeguards in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, please do feel free to contact us with any additional
            questions or feedback you may have in order to make this a better,
            more productive place to practice reading. Thank you!

            Woof Reading uses an AI assistant called{" "}
            <Link className="promptsLinks" to={"claude.ai"}>
              Claude
            </Link>{" "}
            from Anthropic to (1) generate story ideas and questions about those
            stories, and (2) to evaluate the answers to those questions. The
            "evaluations" do not just say "right" or "wrong," but also provide
            contextual feedback to help the reader's understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Why are you using AI?</h3> This technology is particularly good
            at taking prompts - for example, "write a poem about my dog Charlie"
            - and then "writing" stories that are legible, interesting, and if
            you're asking about real-world information ("write a story about
            Abraham Lincoln"), also correct in the vast majority of cases. Most
            relevantly, we're using AI as the basis for Woof Reading because the
            technology makes it possible. Tools such as Claude are particularly
            strong at "synthesizing" or making sense of information and
            providing feedback that is easy to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Woof Reading is NOT intended to replace live instruction, or reading
            with a parent or tutor - it is simply a way to supplement and
            hopefully strengthen these efforts. It is also NOT intended to
            replace the beauty and originality of storytelling. The stories that
            Claude creates are fun (and sometimes witty), but are meant to be
            rather straightforward. The idea here is not to produce profound
            literature, but to simply help with reading comprehension.
          </p>
          <h3>What are you doing to make this app safe to use?</h3>
          <p>
            AI tools are very "intelligent," but are very much guided by what a
            user asks them to do. Woof Reading, for this reason, relies on two
            simple inputs to the Claude system: (1) the type of content to
            create (ex. "poem," "story"), and (2) a fixed set of prompts (story
            ideas) that we have selected, and which a user can choose in the
            app. So for instance, during the game, you may ask Woof Reading to
            write a "poem" about "space travel." You can{" "}
            <Link className="promptsLinks" to={"/prompts"}>
              see all of the pre-set prompts for Woof reading here
            </Link>
            . Put simply, we set the type of stories that can be created so that
            all topics are safe and, ideally, interesting.
          </p>
