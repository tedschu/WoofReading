## Woof Reading Database Schema Documentation

# Overview

The Woof Reading application uses Prisma to manage the schema plus a PostgreSQL database to store user information, scores, badges, and game states. This database is also shared with another frontend application, Woof Math. This document outlines the structure of the database tables and their relationships.

# Tables

1. Users
2. Scores (for Woof Math application)
3. Badges (for Woof Math application)
4. Game States (for Woof Math application)
5. Reading Scores
6. Reading Badges

# Users
